# Registration Form coding challenge

> Please note that this is a NextJS project. For more information please read [here](README.create-next-app.md).

> The website is also hosted on Vercel -> [website link](https://registration-form-delta-khaki.vercel.app/)

## Dev environment

1. Install the npm dependencies - `yarn` or `npm install`
2. Start the dev server - `yarn dev` or `npm run dev`
3. Run tests - `yarn test` or `npm run test`

### What to expect

Once one starts the app one should expect to see a simple home page with 2 buttons on it. One of them will lead the user to the PDF that states the coding challenge and the other will bring him/her to the page that shows-off the potential implementation. Since the challenge had nothing to say about what to do upon submission, the form will simple **alert** the user's values.

### Package justification

-   `tailwindcss` - This package is present just to allow for the overall app structure setup. Although a powerful tool, as per the challenge I am not to use any fancy tools but to demonstrate CSS proficiency instead.
-   `react-hook-form` - This package will bring in both **unification**, **clarity** when it comes to managing forms - error handling, data rules, etc.
